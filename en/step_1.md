## Introduction

In this project you'll make a game that will help you to improve your concentration. You'll have to watch really carefully to try and follow the gift-box with the diamond inside while the other boxes and sprites try to distract you. Playing computer games can be a good way to relax and learn new skills, just make sure you balance gaming with other activities. 

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Watch the box with the diamond inside as it moves around. When the boxes stop moving, click on the one that you think has the gift inside and see if you got it right.
