## What next?

In this project, you have:
+ Used a `not`{:class="block3operators"} block to move gift boxes until they are `not`{:class="block3operators"} `touching`{:class="block3sensing"} each other or the edge of the Stage
+ Used a `repeat`{:class="block3control"} loop to move gift boxes a set number of times
+ Used a `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} block to tell all of the gift boxes when to move

If you are following the Look After Yourself pathway, then you might like to try out the first of our **Make your own** projects, [Looping sprites](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/looping-sprites).

If you want to explore Scratch some more, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch).
